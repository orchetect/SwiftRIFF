# WAV Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates the use of the `SwiftRIFFWAV` package target to read the structure of WAV files, which are based on the RIFF file format.

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> 
> If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
