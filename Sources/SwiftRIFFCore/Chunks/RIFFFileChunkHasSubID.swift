/// Protocol trait for a `RIFFFileChunk` to describe a RIFF file chunk that contains a 4-byte ASCII identifier
/// string as its first four data bytes (after the chunk's name and length bytes).
///
/// For example, the `RIFF` chunk contains this sub-identifier that serves to identify the expected contents of the file.
/// When this sub-ID is `WAVE` this indicates the RIFF file is formatted according to the WAV file specification.
